# Sales Performance Analysis

## Overview

The **Sales Performance Analysis** project is designed to provide insights into sales data through comprehensive analysis and visualization. This project aims to help businesses understand their sales performance over time, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions. By leveraging Python's powerful data manipulation and visualization libraries, this project offers a user-friendly approach to sales data analysis.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Easily load sales data from CSV files.
- **Sales Analysis**: Calculate key performance metrics such as total sales, total revenue, average sales, and average revenue.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate visual representations of sales and revenue trends over time using Matplotlib.
- **Modular Design**: The project is structured in a modular way, allowing for easy extension and maintenance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation library for handling structured data.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Python 3.x**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **pip**: Python package installer (comes pre-installed with Python).

### Installation

 **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JatinDataWizard/Sales-Performance-Analysis.git
   cd Sales-Performance-Analysis
**Install the required packages**:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
### Sample Data
The project includes a sample sales data file located in the data/ directory. The sales_data.csv file contains the following columns:

Date: The date of the sales transaction.
Product: The name of the product sold.
Sales: The number of units sold.
Revenue: The total revenue generated from the sales.
**Usage**
-Analyzing Sales Data
-To analyze the sales data, run the following command in your terminal:
     python src/analysis.py
This script will load the sales data from data/sales_data.csv and print a summary of key performance metrics, including total sales, total revenue, average sales, and average revenue.
**Visualizing Sales Data**
-To visualize the sales data, run the following command:
   python src/visualization.py
This script will generate a line plot showing sales and revenue trends over time. The plot will be displayed in a new window.
**Output**
Sales Performance Summary:
Total Sales: 850
Total Revenue: 8500
Average Sales: 142.85714285714286
Average Revenue: 1428.5714285714287
